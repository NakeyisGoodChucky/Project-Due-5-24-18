Text Adventure - Application Details

Primary Purpose: The application is a "game" that sets up a scenario and then accepts user input to branch to what is most likely a lose state.

Scope: This is a small program where you will have seen everything within 3 tries.

Restrictions: The program only responds to 4 user inputs. Attack or attack will lead to one scenario, Flee or flee will lead to a second scenario and anything else leads to a third scenario.

Dependencies and assumptions: Requires masm32 libraries and assumes user can read and understand english. A keyboard is required for text input.

Technical Functionalities: Program displays a string of text and then accepts user input to branch to one of three scenarios. After the scenario is displayed it waits for a key to be pressed and exits the program.
